    position: relative;
    height: 50rem;//because of the absolute posiioning of the child elememnt it took the parent element out of its natural flow and therefore lost the height.
    //for that reason the perspective was not there anymore(remember that our instructor emphasizd about height(big one) when he introduced perspective property to us. 
    //for float, we would've used a clearfix but for positioning we just added the height that the child element possess to the parent element. It would take a while to fully grasp this but I will
